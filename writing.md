So, you want to submit your article/data/information? Cool!

This guide will show you how to submit your draft to us, so we can publish it.

We request that posts are submitted in markdown format (specifically, [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)), which you can use an online editor, such as [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io/), or [pandao's](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html) for ease of editing.

We've got an example you can copy: [located on our github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knoxschools/knoxschools.us/master/_posts/2017-2-1-first-post.md). Copy that into an editor, and replace it with the info about your article, and write your article. Keep in mind while writing this to adhere to [our policies and ideals](/about/). If your article is deemed to not follow these principles, we will email you back explaining why, and then allow you to resubmit your article.

Now, once you think you are done, [contact us](/contact/) and send us an email with:

  * Your article, in markdown (please attach as .md so your email client doesn't convert it)
  * Any pictures, charts, or other assets you used (attach these to the email, and describe how they are used)
  * [optional] your name and email address

The last one is not required, as you are free to anonymously submit articles and data, but if you'd like credit, you will be listed as a contributor.
