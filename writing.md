So, you want to submit your article/data/information? Cool!

This guide will show you how to submit your draft to us, so we can publish it.

You can write in any format as long as we can get the text out of it (i.e. don't submit in .png or such). I would recommend making a google docs document, then sharing it with us so we can copy it and format it for the website. If you are familiar with markdown, you are encouraged to submit in that format (specifically, [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)), which you can use an online editor, such as [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io/), or [pandao's](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html) for ease of editing.

Keep in mind while writing your article to adhere to [our policies and ideals](/about/). If your article is deemed to not follow these principles, we will email you back explaining why, and then allow you to resubmit your article.

Now, once you think you are done, [contact us](/contact/) and send us an email with:

  * Some way for us to access your article (a URL to google docs, attach a .md file, etc)
  * Any pictures, charts, or other assets you want included (attach these to the email, and describe how they are used)
  * [optional] your name and email address

The last one is not required, as you are free to anonymously submit articles and data, but if you'd like credit, you will be listed as a contributor.
