Hello there!

And welcome to knoxschools.us

Just to be clear: this website is not officially associated with the school. Our writers and editors are all L&N STEM Academy students, though.

This aims to be a real school news site with polls, approval ratings, and editorials from students, and to be free from pressures. For example, we will only remove information which is 'private facts', which is essentially any non-newsworthy facts that someone doesn't want to be published. For example, things like: medical conditions, personal financial info, or personal life details (such as relationships) will not be published here, unless they are newsworthy and pertaining to the person's professional ability (for example, if a teacher was personally bullying a student, we would publish that, because it is directly affecting the person's ability to be a government employee).

Most of what we publish, however, is public knowledge, or empirical evidence we gather from polls, and are mostly opinion polls.

We also publish editorials from students as well, which the students can give a name and email, or remain anonymous. All articles we publish are reviewed to assure they do not violate any of our standards, are factually accurate, and contribute meaningful ideas to the site.

However, if you would like further clarification, or want to report a violation, [contact us](/contact/)
