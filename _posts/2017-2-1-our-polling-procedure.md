In our goal to provide polling data and accurate figures, we will shed some light on how we gather our data:

Here is our poll to ask students what they think about faculty and the school (you can download [poll.txt]({{site.baseurl}}assets/txt/poll.txt)):

We poll randomly in the cafeteria (specifically long lunch lines), and when people are eating lunch. Our whole inquiry takes less than 2 minutes, when people are waiting for buses, just as people are coming to school, and on mondays between 3:30 and 4:30.

In doing this, we hope to have a close-to-random sample which accurately represents the thoughts of the student body as a whole.

If you have any suggestions, leave a comment, or email us (which you can find on the bottom of the page).
